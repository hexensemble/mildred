Learning highlights:

Mastered Java and LibGDX to build a 2D game with advanced mechanics like A* pathfinding, collision detection, and dynamic UIs, while optimizing performance and debugging complex issues.

Notes and future improvements:

The game could benefit from a rebalance, as it's somewhat unforgiving at times. Adjustments to enemy and item placements within levels are needed. Additionally, several quality-of-life improvements could enhance the overall experience. However, it stands as it is for now, a milestone to move forward from.
