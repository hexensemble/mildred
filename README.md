I developed Mildred over six months while learning Java. It's a fully complete game with multiple levels, enemies, UI, save/load functionality, and even a custom level loader. Runs on Mac, Linux, and Windows.

Originally greenlit on Steam, the game needed further refinement before a full retail release. While the core gameplay is intact, it could benefit from balancing tweaks, particularly in enemy difficulty and item placement. Several quality-of-life improvements could also enhance the experience.

Although I eventually moved on to other projects, Mildred remains a significant milestone as my first completed game.
