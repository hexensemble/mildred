Achievements from working on this project:

**Java Mastery:** Deepened understanding of Java through the implementation of core game loops, event handling, and object-oriented principles.

**Use of the LibGDX Framework:** Utilized LibGDX, a popular game development framework, to handle 2D graphics, audio, and game physics effectively.

**Game Mechanics:** Features include enemy interactions, A* pathfinding, collision detection, asset pooling, player controls, and level design, showcasing expertise in gameplay programming.

**User Interfaces:** Created interactive menus, HUDs (heads-up displays), and dynamic UI components.

**Debugging and Optimization:** Solved challenges such as low frame rates, crashes, and resolution issues in early builds, demonstrating strong problem-solving and performance optimization skills.

Notes and future improvements:

The game could benefit from a rebalance, as it's somewhat unforgiving at times. Adjustments to enemy and item placements within levels are needed. Additionally, several quality-of-life improvements could enhance the overall experience. However, it stands as it is for now, a milestone to move forward from.
